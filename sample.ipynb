    "| **Bill Length vs. Species** | The **Histogram** shows a bimodal distribution. Chinstraps and Gentoos have similar (longer) bill lengths, while Adelies have significantly shorter bills. | Bill length alone distinguishes Adelie from the others, but isn't enough to tell Chinstrap and Gentoo apart (you would need body mass for that). |"

    "* **Result 2 (Nuanced):** While Chinstraps generally have longer bills, there is an overlap. The maximum Adelie bill length is often close to or greater than the minimum Chinstrap bill length, meaning bill length *alone* is not a perfect separator without other traits.\n",
